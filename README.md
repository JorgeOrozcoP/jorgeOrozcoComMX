Redesign and web experimentation for jorgeorozco.com.mx

##About jorgeorozco.com.mx
The idea of a webpage started in 2010 after a few approaches with little clients and a few artistic projects. My first personal webpage was jorgeorozcop.com, but it died after a year or so. One thing that I discovered from previous verions and that this site will try to improve is that online shoppers started sending me spam via the Contact section (The site was probably found via twitter, heads up and be careful fellow developers!).

This project also aims to be the first personal approach with git I have. Eventhough I have used it for work and school, I had been very lazy to ever use it personally. But I have discovered the benefits of having an up-to-date github profile, so here I go! Little by little I will upload other projects that I have done. Unfortunately, I will not be able to upload artwork used as most of it doesn't belong to me. 

Happy coding!
